## Hello! I'm Geoff and this is my personal website and github page.

I'm working on a few projects at the moment, this site being one of them.

This website and repository were initially created to fulfill a class requirement for a Geography and Environmental Studies class at Northeastern Illinois University.

The CSS for geoffmbrown.github.io page was taken from a Black Rock Digital Bootstrap template, under the [MIT](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE) license.
